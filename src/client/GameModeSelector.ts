/**
 * THE REACHABILITY RULE (OPE-439). Stated once, here; every other call site
 * in this feature points back at this comment rather than restating it.
 *
 * The backend-reachability signal is the health of ONE thing: the server-list
 * API (`/cluster.json`), as observed by ServerList's heartbeat. It is not a
 * general "is the internet up" light, and in particular it says nothing about
 * whether any given GAME server is up.
 *
 * So it may gate exactly one category of action: the ones that cannot even
 * begin without that API answering first, because nothing has yet told the
 * client which server to talk to.
 *
 *   GATED (API-dependent): creating/hosting a lobby, entering matchmaking,
 *   opening the join-by-code modal. Each has to resolve a server for
 *   something the client has heard nothing about, so a dead list API really
 *   does mean the click cannot work. These dim, and refuse with
 *   reportMultiplayerRefusal.
 *
 *   NOT GATED (socket-sourced): anything whose target arrived over a live
 *   game-server socket -- every card in the public lobby feed, in both the
 *   homepage selector and the detailed browser -- and every join that reaches
 *   Main's funnel (shouldBlockJoin). The card's very existence is proof that
 *   the game server behind it is up and talking to us, which is the only
 *   liveness that join needs. Refusing there could only ever reject a join
 *   that is already under way, over the health of an unrelated API. These
 *   neither dim nor refuse on reachability: they call
 *   shouldBlockSocketSourcedAction, which is the same predicate with the
 *   reachability input nailed shut.
 *
 * The other two inputs (desktop update state, desktop session state) apply to
 * both categories, which is why the two predicates differ only in this one
 * argument.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Whether multiplayer should be available given what we know about the
 * backend.
 *
 * The parameter is ServerList.backendUnreachableConfirmed(), NOT the raw
 * backendReachable(), and the difference is load-bearing. That accessor is
 * already false for the two states this must never gate:
 *
 *   - before the first attempt settles. A page is in that state for its first
 *     few hundred milliseconds, and gating there would lock every player out
 *     of multiplayer on every load over a suspicion we have not tested yet.
 *   - after a single missed heartbeat. The cached list is still serving and
 *     the next request would very likely have worked; taking the game away
 *     for a retry interval over one blip is worse than the blip.
 *
 * It is also false when the API answered with anything short of a 5xx -- a
 * 404 for a site with no list is a reachable backend.
